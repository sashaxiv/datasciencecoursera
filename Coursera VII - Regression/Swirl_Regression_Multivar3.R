| This is the third and final lesson in which we'll look at regression models with more than one independent variable or predictor. We'll begin with WHO hunger data
| which we've taken the liberty to load for you. WHO is the World Health Organization and this data concerns young children from around the world and rates of hunger
| among them which the organization compiled over a number of years. The original csv file was very large and we've subsetted just the rows which identify the gender of
| the child as either male or female. We've read the data into the data frame "hunger" for you, so you can easily access it.

...

|=========| 5%
| As we did in the last lesson let's first try to get a better understanding of the dataset. Use the R function dim to find the dimensions of hunger.

| Now use the R function names to find out what the 13 columns of hunger represent.

| You are amazing!

|=====================|14%
| The Numeric column for a particular row tells us the percentage of children under age 5 who were underweight when that sample was taken. This is one of the columns
| we'll be focussing on in this lesson. It will be the outcome (dependent variable) for the models we generate.

...

|========================== |16%
| Let's first look at the rate of hunger and see how it's changed over time. Use the R function lm to generate the linear model in which the rate of hunger, Numeric,
| depends on the predictor, Year. Put the result in the variable fit.

| Entering the following correct answer for you...

| All that practice is paying off!

| Now look at the coef portion of the summary of fit.

| What is the coefficient of hunger$Year?

2: 0.06053
3: -0.30840
4: 121.14460

| Excellent work!

|=======================================|24%
| What does the negative Estimate of hunger$Year show?

1: As time goes on, the rate of hunger decreases
2: As time goes on, the rate of hunger increases
3: I haven't a clue

Selection: 1

| All that hard work is paying off!

|===========================================|27%
| What does the intercept of the model represent?

1: the number of children questioned in the survey
2: the percentage of hungry children at year 0
3: the number of hungry children at year 0

Selection: 2

| You nailed it! Good job!

|===============================================|30%
| Now let's use R's subsetting capability to look at the rates of hunger for the different genders to see how, or even if, they differ.Once again use the R function
| lm to generate the linear model in which the rate of hunger (Numeric) for female children depends on Year. Put the result in the variable lmF. You'll have to use the
| R construct x[hunger$Sex=="Female"] to pick out both the correct Numerics and the correct Years.

> skip()

| Entering the following correct answer for you...

> lmF <- lm(hunger$Numeric[hunger$Sex=="Female"] ~ hunger$Year[hunger$Sex=="Female"])

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

|==================================================== |32%
| Do the same for male children and put the result in lmM.

> skip()

| Entering the following correct answer for you...

> lmM <- lm(hunger$Numeric[hunger$Sex=="Male"] ~ hunger$Year[hunger$Sex=="Male"])

| Excellent work!

|======================================================== |35%
| Now we'll plot the data points and fitted lines using different colors to distinguish between males (blue) and females (pink).

...

|============================================================ |38%
| We can see from the plot that the lines are not exactly parallel. On the right side of the graph (around the year 2010) they are closer together than on the left side
| (around 1970). Since they aren't parallel, their slopes must be different, though both are negative. Of the following R expressions which would confirm that the slope
| for males is negative?

1: lmM$coef[1]
2: lmF$coef[2]
3: lmM$coef[2]

Selection: 1

| Keep trying!

| First, eliminate the female choice since the question refers to males. Then recall that the first coefficient is the intercept of the line and the second is the
| slope.

1: lmM$coef[1]
2: lmF$coef[2]
3: lmM$coef[2]

Selection: 3

| Keep up the great work!

|================================================================ |41%
| Now instead of separating the data by subsetting the samples by gender we'll use gender as another predictor to create the linear model lmBoth. Recall that to do this
| in R we place a plus sign "+" between the independent variables, so the formula looks like dependent ~ independent1 + independent2.

...

|=====================================================================|43%
| Create lmBoth now. Numeric is the dependent, Year and Sex are the independent variables. The data is "hunger". For lmBoth, make sure Year is first and Sex is second.

> skip()

| Entering the following correct answer for you...

> lmBoth <- lm(hunger$Numeric ~ hunger$Year + hunger$Sex)

| Your dedication is inspiring!

|=========================================================================|46%
| Now look at the summary of lmBoth with the R command summary.

| You're the best!

|=============================================================================|49%
| Notice that three estimates are given, the intercept, one for Year and one for Male. What happened to the estimate for Female? Note that Male and Female are
| categorical variables hence they are factors in this model. Recall from the last lesson (and slides) that R treats the first (alphabetical) factor as the reference
| and its estimate is the intercept which represents the percentage of hungry females at year 0. The estimate given for the factor Male is a distance from the intercept
| (the estimate of the reference group Female). To calculate the percentage of hungry males at year 0 you have to add together the intercept and the male estimate given
| by the model.

...

|================================================================================== |51%
| What percentage of young Males were hungry at year 0?

1: 635.431
2: 1.9027
3: I can't tell since the data starts at 1970.

Selection: 1

| That's the answer I was looking for.

|====================================================================================== |54%
| What does the estimate for hunger$Year represent?

1: the annual decrease in percentage of hungry females
2: the annual decrease in percentage of hungry children of both genders
3: the annual decrease in percentage of hungry males

Selection: 1

| Give it another try.

| The model looked at all the data and didn't specify which gender to consider.

1: the annual decrease in percentage of hungry children of both genders
2: the annual decrease in percentage of hungry females
3: the annual decrease in percentage of hungry males

Selection: 1

| You got it!

|========================================================================================== |57%
| Now we'll replot the data points along with two new lines using different colors.The red line will have the female intercept and the blue line will have the male
| intercept.

...

|===============================================================================================|59%
| The lines appear parallel. This is because

1: they have the same slope
2: I have no idea
3: they have slopes that are very close

Selection: 1

| You got it!

|===================================================================================================|62%
| Now we'll consider the interaction between year and gender to see how that affects changes in rates of hunger. To do this we'll add a third term to the predictor
| portion of our model formula, the product of year and gender.

| Finally, we note that things are a little trickier when we're dealing with an interaction between predictors which are continuous (and not factors). The slides show
| the underlying algebra, but we can summarize.

...

|============================================================================================================================================== |89%
| Suppose we have two interacting predictors and one of them is held constant. The expected change in the outcome for a unit change in the other predictor is the
| coefficient of that changing predictor + the coefficient of the interaction * the value of the predictor held constant.

...

|================================================================================================================================================== |92%
| Suppose the linear model is Hi = b0 + (b1*Ii) + (b2*Yi)+ (b3*Ii*Yi) + ei. Here the H's represent the outcomes, the I's and Y's the predictors, neither of which is a
| category, and the b's represent the estimated coefficients of the predictors. We can ignore the e's which represent the residuals of the model. This equation models a
| continuous interaction since neither I nor Y is a category or factor. Suppose we fix I at some value and let Y vary.

...

|====================================================================================================================================================== |95%
| Which expression represents the change in H per unit change in Y given that I is fixed at 5?
