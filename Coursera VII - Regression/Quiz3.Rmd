Regression Models Wk 3 Quiz

Question 1
Consider the 𝚖𝚝𝚌𝚊𝚛𝚜 data set. Fit a model with mpg as the outcome that includes number of cylinders as a factor variable and weight as confounder. Give the adjusted estimate for the expected change in mpg comparing 8 cylinders to 4.

-3.206

-6.071

-4.256

33.991

Answer

```{r}
data(mtcars)
fit <- lm(mpg ~ factor(cyl) + wt - 1, mtcars) # run without the intercept to check if first coefficient is 4 cylinders
summary(fit)$coef

#Podríamos forzar que los 4 cilindros fuesen el factor a comparar
mcyl<-relevel(factor(mtcars$cyl),"4")
fit<-lm(mpg~mcyl+wt, data = mtcars)
summary(fit)$coef[3]
```

Question 2
Consider the 𝚖𝚝𝚌𝚊𝚛𝚜 data set. Fit a model with mpg as the outcome that includes number of cylinders as a factor variable and weight as a possible confounding variable. Compare the effect of 8 versus 4 cylinders on mpg for the adjusted and unadjusted by weight models. Here, adjusted means including the weight variable as a term in the regression model and unadjusted means the model without weight included. What can be said about the effect comparing 8 and 4 cylinders after looking at models with and without weight included?

Including or excluding weight does not appear to change anything regarding the estimated impact of number of cylinders on mpg.

Within a given weight, 8 cylinder vehicles have an expected 12 mpg drop in fuel efficiency.

Holding weight constant, cylinder appears to have less of an impact on mpg than if weight is disregarded.

Holding weight constant, cylinder appears to have more of an impact on mpg than if weight is disregarded.

```{r}
data(mtcars)
fit2 <- lm(mpg ~ factor(cyl), mtcars) # model without weight included
fit2w <- lm(mpg ~ factor(cyl) + wt, mtcars) # model with weight included
summary(fit2)$coef
##                Estimate Std. Error   t value     Pr(>|t|)
## (Intercept)   26.663636  0.9718008 27.437347 2.688358e-22
## factor(cyl)6  -6.920779  1.5583482 -4.441099 1.194696e-04
## factor(cyl)8 -11.563636  1.2986235 -8.904534 8.568209e-10
summary(fit2w)$coef
##               Estimate Std. Error   t value     Pr(>|t|)
## (Intercept)  33.990794  1.8877934 18.005569 6.257246e-17
## factor(cyl)6 -4.255582  1.3860728 -3.070244 4.717834e-03
## factor(cyl)8 -6.070860  1.6522878 -3.674214 9.991893e-04
## wt           -3.205613  0.7538957 -4.252065 2.130435e-04
```

Answer
-11.564 < 6.071. So Holding weight constant, cylinder appears to have less of an impact on mpg than if weight is disregarded.



Question 3
Consider the 𝚖𝚝𝚌𝚊𝚛𝚜 data set. Fit a model with mpg as the outcome that considers number of cylinders as a factor variable and weight as confounder. Now fit a second model with mpg as the outcome model that considers the interaction between number of cylinders (as a factor variable) and weight. Give the P-value for the likelihood ratio test comparing the two models and suggest a model using 0.05 as a type I error rate significance benchmark.

The P-value is small (less than 0.05). So, according to our criterion, we reject, which suggests that the interaction term is necessary.

The P-value is larger than 0.05. So, according to our criterion, we would fail to reject, which suggests that the interaction terms may not be necessary.

The P-value is larger than 0.05. So, according to our criterion, we would fail to reject, which suggests that the interaction terms is necessary.

The P-value is small (less than 0.05). Thus it is surely true that there is an interaction term in the true model.

The P-value is small (less than 0.05). Thus it is surely true that there is no interaction term in the true model.

The P-value is small (less than 0.05). So, according to our criterion, we reject, which suggests that the interaction term is not necessary.

```{r}
data(mtcars)
fit3 <- lm(mpg ~ factor(cyl) + wt, mtcars) # model with number of cylinders a factor variable and weight as a confounder
summary(fit3)$coef
##               Estimate Std. Error   t value     Pr(>|t|)
## (Intercept)  33.990794  1.8877934 18.005569 6.257246e-17
## factor(cyl)6 -4.255582  1.3860728 -3.070244 4.717834e-03
## factor(cyl)8 -6.070860  1.6522878 -3.674214 9.991893e-04
## wt           -3.205613  0.7538957 -4.252065 2.130435e-04
fit3int <- lm(mpg ~ factor(cyl) * wt, mtcars) # model that considers the interaction between number of cylinders and weight
summary(fit3int)


anova(fit3, fit3int) # compute analysis of variance between two models
## Analysis of Variance Table
## 
## Model 1: mpg ~ factor(cyl) + wt
## Model 2: mpg ~ factor(cyl) * wt
##   Res.Df    RSS Df Sum of Sq      F Pr(>F)
## 1     28 183.06                           
## 2     26 155.89  2     27.17 2.2658 0.1239
```

Answer The P-value is larger than 0.05. So, according to our criterion, we would fail to reject, which suggests that the interaction terms may not be necessary.

Question 4
Consider the 𝚖𝚝𝚌𝚊𝚛𝚜 data set. Fit a model with mpg as the outcome that includes number of cylinders as a factor variable and weight inlcuded in the model as

lm(mpg ~ I(wt * 0.5) + factor(cyl), data = mtcars)

How is the wt coefficient interpretted?

The estimated expected change in MPG per half ton increase in weight.

The estimated expected change in MPG per half ton increase in weight for for a specific number of cylinders (4, 6, 8).

The estimated expected change in MPG per half ton increase in weight for the average number of cylinders.

The estimated expected change in MPG per one ton increase in weight for a specific number of cylinders (4, 6, 8).

The estimated expected change in MPG per one ton increase in weight.

```{r}
data(mtcars)
fit4 <- lm(mpg ~ I(wt * 0.5) + factor(cyl), data = mtcars) 
fit4
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = mpg ~ I(wt * 0.5) + factor(cyl), data = mtcars)
## 
## Coefficients:
##  (Intercept)   I(wt * 0.5)  factor(cyl)6  factor(cyl)8  
##       33.991        -6.411        -4.256        -6.071

?mtcars
```
[, 1]	mpg	Miles/(US) gallon
[, 2]	cyl	Number of cylinders
[, 3]	disp	Displacement (cu.in.)
[, 4]	hp	Gross horsepower
[, 5]	drat	Rear axle ratio
[, 6]	wt	Weight (1000 lbs)
Answer The format for the variable, “wt”" is Weight (1000 lbs). Using I(wt * 0.5) as a predictor in the model effectively doubles the weight coefficient to 2000 lbs (one ton) increase.

```{r}
x <- c(0.586, 0.166, -0.042, -0.614, 11.72)

Question 7
Consider a regression relationship between Y and X with and without adjustment for a third variable Z. Which of the following is true about comparing the regression coefficient between Y and X with and without adjustment for Z.

For the the coefficient to change sign, there must be a significant interaction term.

The coefficient can’t change sign after adjustment, except for slight numerical pathological cases.

It is possible for the coefficient to reverse sign after adjustment. For example, it can be strongly significant and positive before adjustment and strongly significant and negative after adjustment.

Adjusting for another variable can only attenuate the coefficient toward zero. It can’t materially change sign.

Answer It is possible for the coefficient to reverse sign after adjustment. For example, it can be strongly significant and positive before adjustment and strongly significant and negative after adjustment.

Reason There was an example of this in the lectures concerning Adjustment.
