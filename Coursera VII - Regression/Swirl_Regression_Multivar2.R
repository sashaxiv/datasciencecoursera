| You're close...I can feel it! Try it again.

| How many letters are in the sequence of letters A, B, C, D, E, F ?

| That's correct!

| From the boxplot, which spray has the largest median?

ANSWER: B

| You are quite good my friend!

|===================|12%
| Let's first try to get a better understanding of the dataset InsectSprays. Use the R function dim to find the dimensions of the data.

| Entering the following correct answer for you...

> dim(InsectSprays)
[1] 722

| You got it right!

|======================== |15%
| The R function dim says that InsectSprays is a 72 by 2 array. Use the R function head to look at the first 15 elements of InsectSprays.

|=============================|18%
| So this dataset contains 72 counts, each associated with a particular different spray. The counts are in the first column and a letter identifying the spray in the
| second. To save you some typing we've created 6 arrays with just the count data for each spray. The arrays have the names sx, where x is A,B,C,D,E or F. Type one of
| the names (your choice) of these arrays to see what we're talking about.

| Excellent job!

|================================== |21%
| As a check, run the R command summary on the second column of the dataset to see how many entries we have for each spray.(Recall that the expression M[ ,2] yields
| the second column of the array M.)

| You got it right!

|=======================================|24%
| It's not surprising that with 72 counts we'd have 12 count for each of the 6 sprays. In this lesson we'll consider multilevel factor levels and how we interpret
| linear models of data with more than 2 factors.

|===========================================|27%
| Use the R function sapply to find out the classes of the columns of the data.

> skip()

| Entering the following correct answer for you...

> sapply(InsectSprays,class)
count spray 
"numeric""factor" 

| You got it right!

|================================================ |30%
| The class of the second "spray" column is factor. Recall from the slides that the equation representing the relationship between a particular outcome and several
| factors contains binary variables, one for each factor. This data has 6 factors so we need 6 dummy variables. Each will indicate if a particular outcome (a count) is
| associated with a specific factor or category (insect spray).

...

|=====================================================|33%
| Using R's lm function, generate the linear model in which count is the dependent variable and spray is the independent. Recall that in R formula has the form y ~ x,
| where y depends on the predictor x. The data set is InsectSprays. Store the model in the variable fit.

| Entering the following correct answer for you...

> fit <- lm(count ~ spray, InsectSprays)

| You are quite good my friend!

| Using R's summary function, look at the coefficients of the model. Recall that these can be accessed with the R construct x$coef.

| Keep up the great work!

|===============================================================|39%
| Notice that R returns a 6 by 4 array. For convenience, store off the first column of this array, the Estimate column, in a variable called est. Remember the R
| construct for accessing the first column is x[,1].

| Entering the following correct answer for you...

> est <- summary(fit)$coef[,1]

| You are amazing!

|===================================================================|42%
| Notice that sprayA does not appear explicitly in the list of Estimates. It is there, however, as the first entry in the Estimate column. It is labeled as
| "(Intercept)". That is because sprayA is the first in the alphabetical list of the levels of the factor, and R by default uses the first level as the reference
| against which the other levels or groups are compared when doing its t-tests (shown in the third column).

...

|======================================================================== |45%
| What do the Estimates of this model represent? Of course they are the coefficients of the binary or dummy variables associated with sprays. More importantly, the
| Intercept is the mean of the reference group, in this case sprayA, and the other Estimates are the distances of the other groups' means from the reference mean. Let's
| verify these claims now. First compute the mean of the sprayA counts. Remember the counts are all stored in the vectors named sx. Now we're interested in finding the
| mean of sA.

2: -12.41667
3: 0.83333

| You got it right!

| Verify this now by using R's mean function to compute the mean of sprayB.

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

|=======================================================================================|55%
| Let's generate another model of this data, this time omitting the intercept. We can easily use R's lm function to do this by appending " - 1" to the formula, e.g.,
| count ~ spray - 1. This tells R to omit the first level. Do this now and store the new model in the variable nfit.

> skip()

| Entering the following correct answer for you...

| Nice work!

| Notice that sprayA now appears explicitly in the list of Estimates. Also notice how the values of the columns have changed. The means of all the groups are now
| explicitly shown in the Estimate column. Remember that previously, with an intercept, sprayA was excluded, its mean was the intercept, and the values for the other
| sprays (estimates, standard errors, and t-tests) were all computed relative to sprayA, the reference group. Omitting the intercept clearly affected the model.

...

|=====================================================================================================|64%
| What values does the Estimate column now show?

| Without an intercept (reference group) the tests are whether the expected counts (the groups means) are different from zero. Which spray has the least significant
| result?

1: sprayC
2: sprayB
3: sprayF
4: sprayA

Selection: 1

| You are really on a roll!

|===============================================================================================================|70%
| Clearly, which level is first is important to the model. If you wanted a different reference group, for instance, to compare sprayB to sprayC, you could refit the
| model with a different reference group.

...

|==================================================================================================================== |73%
| The R function relevel does precisely this. It re-orders the levels of a factor. We'll do this now. We'll call relevel with two arguments. The first is the factor, in
| this case InsectSprays$spray, and the second is the level that we want to be first, in this case "C". Store the result in a new variable spray2.

| Entering the following correct answer for you...

| Recall that when there is an intercept, the mean of a level that's not the reference, is the intercept + the coefficient (or estimate) of that level, in this case

| Remember that with this model sprayC is the reference group, so the t-test statistics (shown in column 3 of the summary coefficients) compare the other sprays to
| sprayC. These can be computed by hand using the Estimates and standard error from the original model (fit) which used sprayA as the references.

| The slides show the details of this but here we'll demonstrate by calculating the spray2B t value.Subtract fit's sprayC coefficient (fit$coef[3]) from sprayB's

| We glossed over some details in this lesson. For instance, counts can never be 0 so the assumption of normality is violated. We'll explore this issue more when we
